You can call me Nox :) He/him or they/them.

I'm 28 y.o digital artist who codes sometimes! (actually, my degree is closer to coding than to art haha)

**Projects I worked on**
- [Silly fake restaurant page for AVTP site](https://github.com/A-Very-Tall-Problem/avtp-website)
- [Olive Tree Studios site, here and there](https://github.com/olivetreestudiosllc/olive-tree-studios-website)

**Languages and tools**:
- HTML & CSS
- Python
- VS code

In addition I'm familiar with some SASS, pug and bootstrap

I also have some knowledge on how to design databases. 

Hoping to learn more back-end stuff eventually too
